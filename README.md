# Dataiku_Conundrums
Do you want to learn Dataiku? Do you want to challenge yourself with little challenges to learn by doing?

Dataiku provides weekly challenges called [Conundrums](https://community.dataiku.com/t5/Community-Conundrums/Community-Conundrums-Index/td-p/6091) which tests your ability to prepare, visualize, model, and productionalize within Dataiku. This micro challenges range in difficult test all facets of the platform from those Dataiku designers to the avid python coders.

This repository is my take on solving each Dataiku Conundrum. You have the ability to download my projects, see my comments, see how I executed each task, and more. Feel free to participate in the Dataiku Community with questions for my solution.
